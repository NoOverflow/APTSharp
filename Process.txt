[Image Data => This should get ]

-> Get WAV Data
-> Demodulate data (See which method, easiest would be sqrt(pow(x,2)))
-> Filter values (FIR Filter, how do we get the coeffs ?) (Use dsp library ?)
-> Normalize using lowest and highest value (overall) (Get mean value)
-> Get first synchro value using SYNC(A or B, B better ?) pattern
	-> Is one synchro value enough for the whole process ?
	-> Do we synchronise on downsampled / treated values or not ?
-> Resample values to get 4160 Hz (2080px per line, 2 lines per second)
	-> Do we resample line per line or the whole data array
-> Treat line, get color value, add it to image
-> Sync again, get start offset, treat line again
-> Despeckle image

(TODO: Add additionnal treatments)

[Telemetry data]

-> Extract A and B Wedges (Starting at frame_len - 45)

	[Temperature]
		-> Use wedge 14 to get Patch temperature (The satellite heats a patch up to 105K)
			K = Pixel value * 10 (8 -> 10 bits) + 90.113
		-> Use backscan (Wedge 15), to get black body temperature
		-> Use wedge 10-13 to average black body Temperature (Using TPRT Formula page 85)
		-> Get radiance for this averaged temperature
		-> Check and compare from lookup table (XI-6 of pdf manual)

[Questions, do we support one frequency or not]
Pros -> We can be more precise with sync values
Cons -> We only support one frequency
